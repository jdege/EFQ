<p>
	This is a collection of simple demos exploring the motivation behind and the use of
	<a href="https://github.com/jdege/EFQuery">EFQuery</a> -
	a class designed to allow Entity Framework queries to be constructed dynamically in code,
	and to be serialized in whole and in part for storage in databases, passed between client
	and server, etc.
</p>
<p>
	The source code for these demos is available on GitHUB: <a href="https://github.com/jdege/EFQueryDemo">EFQueryDemo</a>.
</p>
<p>
	This project contains an embedded LocalDB database containing test data that was derived from data
	generated by <a href="http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/">http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The schema underlying these demos is simple - we have a web application that is intended to provide
	dispatching and workforce management websites for a number of customers. Each customer will login
	to his own website, and see his own tasks, clients, and workers.
	Our demo database includes only a fragment of the tables needed, and for the early demos will
	assume a single customer and won't require login.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Task</b> - The task that needs to be performed. Each task will have one client and zero or more Workers.</li>
		<li><b>Client</b> - The client that the task is being performed for. A client may have zero or more Tasks.</li>
		<li><b>Worker</b> - A Worker who is assigned to a Task. A Worker may be assigned to zero more more Tasks.</li>
		<li><b>WorkerTask</b> - An intersection table between Worker and Task that tracks the many-to-many relationship between them.</li>
		<li><b>Customer</b> - Not used, yet. </li>
		<li><b>Login</b> - Not used, yet. </li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The task we're addressing, in the initial demos, is presenting the user with a query
	form in which the user can choose a client and/or a worker from select lists, click "Search",
	and see a table containing information about the tasks associated with the selected client, worker,
	or both.
</p>
<p>
	The problem is building a query that might contain a comparison against ClientID, might contain a
	comparison against WorkerID, or might contain both.
</p>
<p>
	The Demos:
	<ol>
		<li><a href="ADO">Simple ADO</a> - When using ADO, a query is simply a string containing SQL</li>
		<li><a href="PlainEF">Plain Entity Framework</a> - With EF, in the simple case you can build up a query using IQueryable obects.</li>
		<li>
			<a href="PredicateBuilder">Predicate Builder</a> -
			Pete Montgomery's <a href="https://petemontgomery.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/a-universal-predicatebuilder/">PredicateBuilder</a>
			will allow you to construct a query from pieces in more complicated ways that using plain EF.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="EFQuery">EFQuery</a> -
			EFQuery wraps PredicateBuilder, and when used directly works much the same way.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="EFQueryOnServer">EFQuery on server</a> - EFQuery allows you to create partial
			queries and combine the separately. Here we're combining them on the server.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="EFQueryOnClient">EFQuery on client</a> -EFQuery allows you to create partial
			queries and combine the separately. Here we're combining them on the client.
		</li>
	</ol>
